# Tools

Here we'll look at some common tools and libraries used in C++. What I present aren't the only implementations of their kind but, popular ones on Linux.

For most Linux distros, these tools can be installed via the package manager (packages `cmake`, `doxygen` and `gdb`). 
Note that you will likely need to install `graphviz` for Doxygen. 
For Windows, you can find precompiled binaries online (I'll provide links in their relative chapters) except for gdb and gprof, which are Linux tools.
