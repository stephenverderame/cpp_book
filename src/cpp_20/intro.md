# C++20

In light of my tip to stay updated, I'm going to provide a very brief tour of some C++20 features.
Some others C++20 features that I don'tmention here or in the concurrency section include: constexpr constructors and destructors, a better date library,
`consteval`, `constinit`, `std::format`, and `std::syncstream`s.
