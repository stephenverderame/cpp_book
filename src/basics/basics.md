# Basics

A great source of information would be [A Tour of C++ 2nd Edition](https://github.com/Kikou1998/textbook/blob/master/A%20Tour%20of%20C%2B%2B%20(2nd%20Edition)%20(C%2B%2B%20In-Depth%20Series).pdf)
[C++ Primer 5th Edition](https://github.com/yanshengjia/cpp-playground/blob/master/cpp-primer/resource/C%2B%2B%20Primer%20(5th%20Edition).pdf) 
is also very thorough but is more geared towards those without much programming experience.

If you're into video tutorials, I have heard that [The Cherno Project](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw) is a good resource,
although I've never watched them myself. I watched [John Purcell](https://caveofprogramming.teachable.com/courses) whose videos are at
a pace for completely new/beginner programmers.
